title: "Shared Ownership"
description: "Avoid shared ownership, here is my experience..."
---

Just before Christmas, in 2006, we were notified that we would be evicted from a two bedroom maisonette we were renting. Turns out we were illegally sub-letting the property, as it was a shared ownership property and the owner shouldn't have been renting it out.

We started looking for somewhere else to live, 2 bedroom flats in Stratford-upon-Avon ranged between £700-1000 a month to rent.

Whilst we were looking I did some research to see if we could get a mortgage, and how much we could borrow. My wife and I both worked full-time, but we were paid so little that 4x our combined salary would only allow us to get a mortgage of £100,000.

The prices of two bedroom properties started at around £150,000... but whilst looking we noticed there were new build shared-ownership flats available.

We could buy a 50% share, and pay rent on the other half. The mortgage payments worked out to be around £400 a month, and the rent worked out to be around £250 a month; including ground rent and service charge.

Our choices were renting for £700 a month, or buying a shared ownership property and paying £650 a month. Fourtunately my parents were able to give us the 10% deposit required for the mortgage, so we went for it.


## Five years later...

We both had jobs in Rugby, the commute was slowly killing us, so we decided to sell the flat. We contacted the shared-ownership company, [Bromford Homes](http://www.bromfordhomes.co.uk/), asking them how to do this...

We had to pay them to arrange an independent valuation the flat; we could not advertise it for more than this amount, nor could we accept offers for more, or for less, than this amount.

We had to sell it to someone who qualified for their shared-ownership scheme, if their household income was too low, or too high, then they would not be allowed to buy it.

We were not allowed to use an estate agent for the first 6 months. Bromford had to have time to contact people on their waiting list.

Straight away Bromford found a buyer who came for a viewing and made us an offer. We accepted, but eventually the buyer pulled out as they were not able to get a mortgage. Their bank refused to lend them the money because it was a shared-ownership property.

We didn't receive a single viewing from Bromford after that.


## Six months later...

Bromford weren't advertising the property anywhere, so we went to an estate agent who advertised it in the local papers, on Rightmove, etc.


## One year later...

Still no offers.

The banks weren't lending to the sort of people that qualified for shared-ownership.

I seriously considered stop paying the mortgage and letting the bank repossess it.

We gave up all hope of ever selling. Trapped.

It dawned on us that the only way we were going to be able to sell the flat, was to buy the remaining half from Bromford, and sell the entire property without any restrictions.

Problem is, we didn't have any money for a deposit to increase the mortgage. I couldn't go back to my parents, I had cleared them out for a deposit on the first half.


## Meanwhile...

Another shared-ownership flat in our block was for sale.

The owner had found a buyer, accepted their offer, and started the process to sell it. But then, at the eleventh hour, Bromford got involved and stopped the sale, the buyer didn't meet the criteria for the shared-ownership scheme.

He gave up trying to sell his flat in the end.


## But then, from the darkness...

My parents received a substantial sum of money, my brother had just recently died, and unknown to any of us, [his employer](http://www.sitel.com/) had life insurance policies on all of their staff, which paid out to the employee's next of kin.

They decided to lend us the deposit we needed, in order to get a mortgage to buy the other half of the flat from Bromford. The process was stressful, it took 3 months of chasing various solicitors, but we now owned the entire property.


## No restrictions...

Now that we owned the entire flat, there were no restrictions on selling it. We put it on the market with an estate agent, [Jeremy & Co](http://www.jeremyandco.co.uk/), and straight away they were getting us viewings.

We had at least one viewing a week for about 6 months, but for some reason we didn't get a single offer. The estate agent was excellent at advertising, but clearly had problems actually selling it.

We moved to another estate agent, [RA Bennett & Partners](http://www.rabennett.co.uk/), and within a week we received an offer. The buyer pulled out of the sale after 4 weeks, which was frustrating, but a few days later our estate agent had found us another buyer.

The sale has just recently completed, we sold it to a landlord, you can rent our old flat for £700 per month.


## Conclusion...

I'm never buying another property ever again.

If you are, avoid shared-ownership.
