description: "A recipe for the Polish National dish, Bigos."

I was inspired to try to recreate this after eating it at the International Food Festival in Birmingham. According to some recipes I found, it is considered to be the Polish National Dish.

Like many stews, the recipes will differ as it can made in so many different ways, so don't worry if you can't find any of these ingredients, just use your common sense to find a substitute. Just as you would when cooking any other stew or casserole, feel free to chuck anything in that you have going spare, the whole point to this stew is to make use of things so don't spend a fortune on ingredients.

The main ingredients are White Cabbage, Sauerkraut, and Pork - but here are the ingredients I used, the weights aren't an exact science, so just have a go...


## Ingredients

- White Cabbage (x1)
- Sauerkraut Staropolska (Kapusta Kiszona Starolpolska) 820g jar (in water, not vinegar)
- Diced Casserole Pork (500g)
- Smoked Bacon Lardons (200g)
- Polish Sausage (Kielbasa Zwyczajna) _Middle Minced, Smoked & Steamed_ (358g)
- Pepperami Hot (x1) - _Clearly not traditional, but I felt like it!_
- Dried Mushrooms (20g)
- Large Onion (x1)
- Shallots (x8 Baby Onions)
- Garlic (x4 Cloves)
- Celery (x4 Sticks)
- Carrots (x2)
- Majoram (2 tsp)
- Caraway Seeds (1 tsp) - _Crushed in a pestle and mortar_
- Bay Leaves (x2)
- Chopped Tomatoes (400g Tin)
- Tomato Puree (x1 squirt)
- Beef Oxo Cube
- Vegetable Stock Cube
- Lech Beer (500ml Bottle) - _Entirely optional, just make sure it is lager if you go for it._


## Preparation

1. Roughly chop the White Cabbage. The leaves on a white cabbage are tightly wrapped, so don't bother trying to peel the leaves first, just chop it up. I put mine on its side and cut ~1-2cm thick disks and separated it with my fingers.

2. Roughly chop the Large Onion. Cut the horrible bit off the bottom, peel it, cut it in half, then slice it into ~0.5-1cm thick slices and separate it with your fingers.

3. Peel the Baby Onions. This is easier if you cut the horrible bit off the bottom first.

4. Finely chop/crush the Garlic.

5. Peel the Carrots, cut in them half lengthways, and roughly chop them into ~2cm chunks.

6. Wash and roughly chop the Celery sticks into ~1cm slices.

7. Slice the Polish Sausage into ~1cm thick discs.

8. Slice the Pepperami Hot into ~0.5-1cm thick discs.


## Cook

1. Put a large frying pan on the hob on a high heat. Once hot, pour in a little olive oil and chuck in the Smoked Bacon Lardons and Diced Casserole Pork. You just want to seal the Pork, so it just needs a few minutes. Season with salt and pepper as you are cooking, and be sure to turn the pork so it is sealed on all sides - it should turn from pink to white.

2. Once sealed, turn the heat off from under the frying pan and just leave it on the hob to keep warm.

3. Put a very large saucepan (preferably a Casserole Dish, but I didn't have one that was big enough) on the hob on a high heat. Once hot, pour in a little olive oil and chuck in the sliced Large Onion, the celery and the carrots just to soften them up. Season with salt and pepper as you are cooking them.

4. Once the sliced onions have started to soften, chuck in the White Cabbage, pour in the bottle of Lager and cover with a lid so that it steams the cabbage. The Lager won't cover the cabbage, but it should help to soften it. If you don't want to use Lager, then add 500ml of water.

5. Occassionally remove the lid and stir, after about 5 or 10 minutes the cabbage should have started to soften.

6. Now turn the heat off on the hob and chuck everything in the large saucepan (or Casserole Dish). Everything in the ingredients list should now be in the one pot.

7. Boil the Kettle and pour into the pot, just enough water to cover.

8. Put the pot into the oven, with the lid on, and cook it low and slow for at least 2 hours at 160 C (Fan Assisted Oven), or 180 C, or 350 F, or Gas Mark 4. The best thing to do is to follow the cooking instructions on the Diced Casserole Pork as this is the only raw ingredient that you __must__ cook properly.

9. You may want to take it out of the oven after an hour to give it a stir, then return to the oven for another hour. You shouldn't need to top it up with water during the cooking process.

10. Serve into bowls and eat. _Remove the Bay Leaves if you discover them when serving._
