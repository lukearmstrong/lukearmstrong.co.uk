# Luke Armstrong

I am a passionate developer who enjoys working within the fast evolving world of web development. My seven years of commercial experience within the industry has emerged from an initial interest at an early age, and is something which has lead to a continued pursuit of professional development on my part.

Initially a full time freelancer who completed sites outsourced by a local agency, I built up a portfolio before taking on outsourced projects from other agencies based in Liverpool, Brighton and Gloucestershire. Seeking employment was the next logical step, as the experience and knowledge that can be gained from working alongside other designers and developers is invaluable.

## Skills & Expertise

### HTML5 & CSS3
Hand coded and validated to W3C standards. Tested on several browsers across many platforms. Using polyfills, or degrading gracefully, on browsers that do not support certain features. I am currently learning about responsive web design techniques.

### JavaScript
Using unobtrusive degradable techniques. I have experience writing with, and without, jQuery. Recently I have been using RequireJS to manage JavaScript files in projects.

### PHP
Experience writing bespoke web applications, content management systems and e-commerce systems. I have kept up with the latest releases of PHP, and switch to them as soon as they are released. I have experience with using Laravel, FuelPHP and CodeIgniter frameworks.

The PHP Community seems to have matured and become less fragmented over the past 12-24 months. I read up about projects like "PHP: The Right Way", and PHP-FIG: PSR 0/1/2/3/4. Composer is a very useful tool. I am interested in Symfony 2 components, "The League of Extraordinary Packages" and other interesting packages on packagist.

### MySQL
As I write bespoke CMS and e-commerce systems, these require me to design a database structure for each project. I am interested in monitoring applications and optimising queries to improve performance.

### Linux
Up until recently I was using Ubuntu 12.04 LTS on my work and home machines, I have used Linux as my workstation OS for at least 5 years now. I also have experience setting up and maintaining RHEL and Debian based servers. I have a Linode server, just to play with, it is running Ubuntu Server with Nginx, PHP 5.4, MySQL and Ruby (using Unicorn).

### Mac OSX
Recently I have been using a MacBook Air and have switched to it from Linux as my workstation.

### Version Control Systems
Initially we started out with SVN, it was dreadfully slow, and a nightmare when it came to dealing with merge conflicts. We only put up with SVN for a single project, and switched to Mercurial for the next project. We used Mercurial for about a year, but once we started using frameworks that were hosted on GitHub, we made the switch to Git to be able to harness the power of Git submodules, and to easily contribute code back to the projects. I use Git in the command line.

### Ruby on Rails
I have a personal interest in the Ruby language and this framework for several years now, I just wish I had more of an opportunity to use it.

### C and C++
I have recently started learning C, and am also interested in learning C++.

### ASP.NET 2.0
I have previous experience of working with ASP.NET, when I was freelancing I built bespoke CMS and e-commerce systems using C# for Windows server platforms.

## Experience


### Web Developer at [The Higgs Design Co.](http://higgsdesign.com/)
**04/2013 – Present**

I am currently working as a developer at this agency in Birmingham. Working as part of a much smaller team, 2 developers and 2 designers, has given me valuable experience communicating with clients directly, and managing my time and resources to meet deadlines independently.

I am developing bespoke applications using v4 of the Laravel Framework. These applications have needed me to develop integrations using APIs from Akkroo, Amazon Web Services, Facebook, Twitter, Parse.com, Pure360, Shopify and bespoke APIs.


### Web Developer at [Propeller Communications](http://www.propcom.co.uk/)
**11/2009 – 04/2013**

Working as a developer at a successful agency with offices in Rugby and London. Here I developed bespoke CMS and e-commerce systems using PHP 5.4 and MySQL. I work alongside 40 other designers, front-end developers and back-end developers, with roughly 5-6 people on each project. I have lead the development of several projects.

We initially wrote every project from scratch, around a core library of reusable code. Then we decided to switch to using the CodeIgniter Framework, we used that for several projects, but when PHP 5.3 was released we moved onto using FuelPHP.

I have developed integrations using APIs from SagePay, Netsuite, Micros, Google Maps, Postcode Anywhere, and countless others.

Whilst the majority of our work is for clients, I have also been involved in the development of internal systems. We have developed our own e-marketing system that is used by hundreds of clients, I worked on part of the system that allows a user to build a mailer from a template.


### Web Developer at [FGI Training & Consultancy](http://www.fgiltd.co.uk/)
**08/2008 – 07/2009**

Working in-house, alongside a graphic designer and marketing executive, to re-brand the company and develop a new website with the ability to book training courses.

I built the site to the XHTML 1.0 Strict standard, with CSS 2, and unobtrusive and degradable JavaScript. It was developed without using a framework, and whilst it was not following the MVC pattern, I had separated controller logic and view code by using Smarty. I also wrote a database abstraction layer for MySQLi, and a session handling class which stored sessions in the database.

Shortly after launching the new site the spending on PPC campaigns was reduced significantly, as we were consistently ranked in the first 3 results for our search terms.


### Freelance Web Developer
**05/2006 – 08/2008**

Bespoke frontend, CMS and e-commerce development. Using ASP.NET 2.0 and MySQL or PHP and MySQL. Working entirely with agencies, they outsourced the development to me.
