description: Curriculum Vitae for Luke Armstrong
---

I am a passionate developer who enjoys working within the fast evolving world of web development. My eight years of commercial experience within the industry has emerged from an initial interest at an early age, and is something which has lead to a continued pursuit of professional development on my part.

Initially a full time freelancer who completed sites outsourced by a local agency, I built up a portfolio before taking on outsourced projects from other agencies based in Liverpool, Brighton and Gloucestershire. Seeking employment was the next logical step, as the experience and knowledge that can be gained from working alongside other designers and developers is invaluable.

## Skills & Expertise

### Front-end Development
Hand-coded HTML5 and CSS3 and validated to W3C standards. Tested on several browsers across many platforms and devices. Using polyfills, or degrading gracefully, on browsers that do not support certain features. I have experience with Less and Sass pre-processors.

Responsive design is crucial now that many people are browsing using mobiles and tablets. Front-end optimization is even more important now that these devices are used over relatively slow free Wifi or 3G connections. I originally used Ant as my build tool, but am now using Gulp.

I am always researching and reading up about new techniques and tools, front-end development has evolved rapidly over the past few years.

### JavaScript
Using unobtrusive degradable techniques. I have experience writing with, and without, jQuery. Recently I have been using RequireJS to manage JavaScript files in projects. I have briefly played with Node.js using Express and Mongo.


### PHP
Experience writing bespoke web applications, content management systems and e-commerce systems. I have kept up with the latest releases of PHP, and switch to them as soon as they are released. I have experience with using Laravel, FuelPHP and CodeIgniter frameworks.

The PHP Community seems to have matured and become less fragmented over the past 2 years. I read up about projects like "PHP: The Right Way", and PHP-FIG: PSR 0/1/2/3/4. Composer is a very useful tool. I am interested in Symfony 2 components, "The League of Extraordinary Packages" and other interesting packages on packagist.

I'm predominately working with Laravel, currently using the beta for v5, though when working on smaller projects I will use Silex.

### MySQL
As I write bespoke CMS and e-commerce systems, these require me to design a database structure for each project. I am interested in monitoring applications and optimising queries to improve performance. I write migrations to create the database structure as this ensures the structure is kept under version control and it can be deployed on other servers easily, both of which are ideal for working in teams.

### Linux
I have used Ubuntu Linux as my workstation OS for the majority of my career, though did spend a year using a MacBook Air, which was nice. I have experience setting up and maintaining RHEL and Debian based servers. I have a Linode server, just to play with, it is running Ubuntu Server with Nginx, PHP 5.6, MySQL and Ruby (using Unicorn).

### Version Control Systems
Initially I started out with SVN whilst working at Propeller Communications, it was dreadfully slow, and a nightmare when it came to dealing with merge conflicts. We only put up with SVN for a single project, and switched to Mercurial for the next project. We used Mercurial for about a year, but once we started using frameworks that were hosted on GitHub, we made the switch to Git to be able to harness the power of Git submodules, and to easily contribute code back to the projects. I use Git in the command line.
